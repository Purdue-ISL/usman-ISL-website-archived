Prof. Rao is a faculty at [Purdue University]  with research interests in Computer Networks. In the past, he has been been a Visiting Research Scientist at the Computer Science Department of [Princeton University] (Feb â€“Aug, 2015), *Google* (June 2011-July 2012), and at *AT&T Research* (May 2006-June 2006). His research has been recognized with an NSF CAREER award (2010), and with the **ACM SIGMETRICS Test of Time Award (2011)**.

Prof Rao's current research has a few broad themes:

- **Networks with verifiable performance properties:** Designing and managing large networks is challenging today. By many estimates a large portion of the IT budget of organizations is driven by the need to manage networks, with configuration errors and design faults often accounting for a large fraction of cyber-attacks. My work seeks to verify that network designs meet desired performance properties, and seeks to synthesize network designs in a principled manner with verifiable properties.


- **Low latency mobile web:** The latency of web applications is critical, and by many estimates even hundreds of milliseconds of latency can impact business revenue and user engagement. The issues are particularly relevant in cellular networks, where web latencies are 6X desktop environments. My research seeks to address this gap through a novel cloud-based approach that redundantly execute Web pages on behalf of the client, and scales computation through the use of programming language techniques.


- **Delivering Internet video with high quality of experience:** Recent years have seen a tremendous increase in the popularity of Internet video, which forms a major fraction of Internet traffic today. We are investigating ways to deliver high quality video across diverse and variable network conditions, leveraging new opportunities provided by cloud computing.


Some of his past work has developed abstraction-driven approaches to driven network design and configuration, designed trust-worthy peer-to-peer systems, and pioneered Internet peer-to-peer video streaming.
